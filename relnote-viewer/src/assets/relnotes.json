This also affects AFP users which perform actions that trigger the execution of WF actions in ACP. \"Trusted callers\" of WF actions can be registered in CODE_SEC_WFA_TRUST_CALLER, to avoid the necessity of setting up all required WFA rights on the users. \"Trusted callers\" are programs which execute WF actions that cannot be overruled by the session user (e.g. AFP user), but are given by the system and therefore do not need to be explicitly granted to the user, which simplifies the WFA security administration. \r\nWith this release, we have registered all relevant sources in which WF actions are triggered by AFP users."
